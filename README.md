# Module_5_matplotlib
## Background 
Supposedly, a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications hired me as a senior data analyst. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, I have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Overt he course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.

## Repo Outlook
A new repository named, "Module_5_matplotlib" is created, and cloned to the local computer. A folder named "Pymaceuticals" is created in the local repository and pushed to the main branch. This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook, where the analysis is perfomed. The folder also has another sub-folder named 'data' which contains the csv files provided for the analysis to be done.
